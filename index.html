            <h3>Project 1 : Rat In A Maze BOT/h3>
            <p>My Arduino maze bot project is a thrilling challenge where I programmed a bot to navigate a maze at the fastest rate. Using sensors, the bot detects walls and strategically chooses the quickest route. I love the problem-solving aspect, constantly refining the code to shave off milliseconds and achieve the optimal run. It's a great blend of creativity and logic, pushing the bot's limits to see how quickly it can conquer the maze.</p>

            <h3>Project 2: Making Presentations</h3>
            <p>My presentations are like meticulously designed journeys, taking the audience on a path towards understanding. The slides are my roadmap, each one strategically crafted to unveil a new piece of information or build upon the last. Visuals become my companions, statistics morph into compelling infographics, and text condenses into clear, concise points. I'm the guide, weaving a narrative that's both informative and engaging. Animation becomes a tool to highlight key points, not a flashy distraction. A well-placed joke can break the tension and keep the audience connected. Ultimately, my presentations are more than just delivering facts; they're about sparking curiosity, fostering discussion, and leaving a lasting impression..</p>
